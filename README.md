# Project #6 - pipex

This project left me discover in detail a UNIX mechanism: Redirections and Pipes.

It aimed to deepen my understanding of these two concepts.

Also, it was an introductory project for bigger UNIX projects that appear later on in the 42 cursus as Minishell (which aim is to create a simple shell).
